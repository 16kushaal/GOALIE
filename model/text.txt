      "0": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Welcome to Old Trafford! The Theatre of Dreams is a cauldron of noise. Red scarves waving like wildfire. Kickoff under the floodlights—it’s Manchester United kicking off from right to left, wearing their classic red with black trim. City in their sky blue, poised and clinical. Erik ten Hag stands arms folded, Pep Guardiola bouncing on his toes with manic energy. We’re underway!" },
      "1": { "type": "commentary", "text": "City immediately assert themselves with early possession. Rodri touches it, then back to Dias. They’re building patiently from the back. De Bruyne drops deep, linking with Stones. United in their mid-block, with Bruno pressing the pivot. Garnacho already looks sharp—he’s nipping at Walker’s heels. The intensity is unreal. Rashford leads a sprint press—forces Ederson into an early long ball that Varane heads down cleanly. The crowd roars in approval." },
      "2": { "type": "commentary", "text": "United now in possession. Casemiro receives from Onana, swivels neatly under pressure from Foden. Casemiro threads one through the lines—finds Fernandes between City’s midfield strata. Bruno turns, looks up—GOES LONG! Rashford is chasing! But Ederson is off his line early and clears it into touch. A little early warning from United: they will go direct when space opens up." },
      "3": { "type": "commentary", "text": "City regain control. De Bruyne drops into the left half-space, gives it to Bernardo Silva, who flicks it back to Grealish. Grealish with that slow-glide dribble, facing Dalot. He shimmies left, cuts right, lays it off to Rodri. Rodri from 30 yards... he has a look... SHOOTS! Wide. But that came from five uninterrupted passes. That’s City—a python tightening with every touch." },
      "4": { "type": "commentary", "text": "United not shying away though. Casemiro picks Grealish’s pocket and launches a counter. Garnacho takes off on the right—he's got space! Darts past Gvardiol—whips in a curling cross! Cleared by Stones! Rebound falls to McTominay—he HITS IT! Blocked again by Rodri who slid across. Brave defending. The fans are loving this end-to-end edge." },
      "5": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Guardiola is already out in his technical area, animatedly signaling for compactness in midfield. City look to settle again. Alvarez and De Bruyne rotate, causing a brief mismatch. Ball with Walker—he darts forward this time—slips a disguised ball to Foden! In the box! Shoots near post—SAVED by Onana! Big moment! The Cameroon keeper is up to the task." },
      "6": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Corner to City. De Bruyne swings it in—a deep one! Dias rises—he nods it toward goal—cleared off the line by Garnacho! The teenager putting in the hard yards on both ends. City recycle it. Silva to Grealish—he flicks it over Dalot—ohh, cheeky! Pulls it back—but Casemiro intercepts. The Brazilian maestro is rolling back the years tonight." },
      "7": { "type": "commentary", "text": "United launch another attack. Onana rolls it short this time, inviting City’s press. It’s risky—but Casemiro pirouettes under pressure, then lays it off to Varane. Long diagonal to Rashford—he cushions it brilliantly on the chest. Turns Walker! Shoots from a tight angle—just wide! The crowd rises as one. That’s vintage Rashford, direct and devastating." },
      "8": { "type": "commentary", "text": "City now increase the tempo. Rodri to Stones to De Bruyne—first time pass to Foden who ghosts between Shaw and Varane. Slips it to Alvarez—edge of the D. One touch—turns—SHOOTS! Blocked! Varane throws himself into the line of fire. That’s world-class defending. Every touch is a threat. You can feel the tension ratcheting up." },
      "9": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Frenetic pace now. Bruno is barking orders, Rashford clapping his hands, urging the press. United are in a 4-4-2 out of possession, pressing triggers triggered every time the ball goes wide. City are adjusting—Stones inverts into midfield now. Bernardo overlaps Walker—it’s a chessboard with jet engines." },
      "10": { "type": "commentary", "text": "We hit ten minutes and there’s barely been time to breathe. Possession favors City, but United have had the clearer shot on goal. Tactical discipline meets tactical chaos. The stadium is thunderous. No goals yet—but the tension is tangible, like storm clouds ready to burst. You just know something is coming." },
      "11": { "type": "commentary", "text": "De Bruyne begins to dictate again—City rotating triangles on the right now. Walker to Silva, back to Walker, slips it between the lines to De Bruyne. He looks up—switches it diagonally to Grealish on the left! It’s inch-perfect! Grealish brings it down—fakes inside—lays it to Rodri—who threads it to Alvarez—SHOT BLOCKED AGAIN! Lisandro Martinez this time. It’s heroic defending from United." },
      "12": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Old Trafford erupts as United counter at blistering speed. Garnacho picks up the loose ball, skips inside one, two blue shirts! He lays it into Bruno Fernandes—Bruno chips it forward—Rashford is in behind! But Ederson rushes out like a sweeper-keeper and boots it away! That was inches from a 1-v-1! The crowd gasps, Guardiola is losing his mind on the touchline!" },
      "13": { "type": "commentary", "text": "City respond immediately. It’s now relentless back-and-forth. Foden combines with Stones, who has completely taken up a midfield role now. He slides it into De Bruyne—first-time ball to Grealish again! He goes for the byline—pulls it back across goal! But there’s no one there! Alvarez was a step late. United breathe." },
      "14": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Casemiro slows it down for United. He shields, swivels, and passes to Shaw who finds Bruno in the left half-space. Fernandes has space! He threads a low ball to Rashford who turns—SHOOTS from 25 yards! STINGS the palms of Ederson! Great strike! Still goalless but you wouldn’t know it from the drama!" },
      "15": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Fifteen minutes gone and it’s a tactical arms race. Stones is essentially a No. 6 now, and Rodri drops into the backline. Guardiola adjusting like it’s a chess match. Ten Hag shouts for McTominay to push up between City’s lines. United’s pressing shape morphs into a 4-3-3. This is high-level strategy on the fly." },
      "16": { "type": "commentary", "text": "City almost carve United open. De Bruyne drops between the lines, receives from Rodri, turns—and fires a through ball that splits the center-backs—Foden’s in! One touch—tries to chip Onana—JUST OVER! Heart-in-mouth stuff for United! That pass from De Bruyne was surgical." },
      "17": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Garnacho is United’s livewire. He’s got the ball again—takes on Gvardiol—burns past him! Into the box! Pulls it across to Rashford! Shot—DEFLECTED! Loops into the air—and Ederson punches it clear under pressure from McTominay. It's carnage in City’s penalty box!" },
      "18": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Another attack, another interception—this time by Rodri. He’s everywhere—recycles possession calmly, then goes vertical to Alvarez. Alvarez holds it up—waits—lays it to De Bruyne, who chips it over the top—Foden’s in again! Controls! SHOOTS—BLOCKED by Varane again! United are throwing bodies like it’s a warzone." },
      "19": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Guardiola applauds the buildup but his face is stone. He knows these missed chances could come back to haunt. City dominate possession now—71%—but United’s threat in transition is real. Shaw and Dalot are tucked in narrow, almost forming a back five out of possession. Ten Hag’s plan is clear: compress, survive, break." },
      "20": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Still no goals, but you’d think it’s 3–3 with the energy inside Old Trafford. Every challenge, every flick, every break is met with roars. Both teams have tested the keepers, defenders are blocking like their lives depend on it, and the tempo is ferocious. The stage is set—something’s going to give soon." },

Kickoff under the floodlights—it’s Manchester United kicking off from right to left, wearing their classic red with black trim. City in their sky blue, poised and clinical. Erik ten Hag stands arms folded, Pep Guardiola bouncing on his toes with manic energy. We’re underway!" },

De Bruyne drops deep, linking with Stones. United in their mid-block, with Bruno pressing the pivot. Garnacho already looks sharp—he’s nipping at Walker’s heels. The intensity is unreal. Rashford leads a sprint press—forces Ederson into an early long ball that Varane heads down cleanly. The crowd roars in approval." },
      "2": { "type": "commentary", "text": "United now in possession. Casemiro receives from Onana, swivels neatly under pressure from Foden. Casemiro threads one through the lines—finds Fernandes between City’s midfield strata. Bruno turns, looks up—GOES LONG! Rashford is chasing! But Ederson is off his line early and clears it into touch. A little early warning from United: they will go direct when space opens up." },
      "3": { "type": "commentary", "text": "City regain control. De Bruyne drops into the left half-space, gives it to Bernardo Silva, who flicks it back to Grealish. Grealish with that slow-glide dribble, facing Dalot. He shimmies left, cuts right, lays it off to Rodri. Rodri from 30 yards... he has a look... SHOOTS! Wide. But that came from five uninterrupted passes. That’s City—a python tightening with every touch." },

Darts past Gvardiol—whips in a curling cross! Cleared by Stones! Rebound falls to McTominay—he HITS IT! Blocked again by Rodri who slid across. Brave defending. The fans are loving this end-to-end edge." },
      "5": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Guardiola is already out in his technical area, animatedly signaling for compactness in midfield. City look to settle again. Alvarez and De Bruyne rotate, causing a brief mismatch. Ball with Walker—he darts forward this time—slips a disguised ball to Foden! In the box! Shoots near post—SAVED by Onana! Big moment! The Cameroon keeper is up to the task." },

The teenager putting in the hard yards on both ends. City recycle it. Silva to Grealish—he flicks it over Dalot—ohh, cheeky! Pulls it back—but Casemiro intercepts. The Brazilian maestro is rolling back the years tonight." },

It’s risky—but Casemiro pirouettes under pressure, then lays it off to Varane. Long diagonal to Rashford—he cushions it brilliantly on the chest. Turns Walker! Shoots from a tight angle—just wide! The crowd rises as one. That’s vintage Rashford, direct and devastating." },

He looks up—switches it diagonally to Grealish on the left! It’s inch-perfect! Grealish brings it down—fakes inside—lays it to Rodri—who threads it to Alvarez—SHOT BLOCKED AGAIN! Lisandro Martinez this time. It’s heroic defending from United." },
      "12": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Old Trafford erupts as United counter at blistering speed. Garnacho picks up the loose ball, skips inside one, two blue shirts! He lays it into Bruno Fernandes—Bruno chips it forward—Rashford is in behind! But Ederson rushes out like a sweeper-keeper and boots it away! That was inches from a 1-v-1! The crowd gasps, Guardiola is losing his mind on the touchline!" },

De Bruyne drops between the lines, receives from Rodri, turns—and fires a through ball that splits the center-backs—Foden’s in! One touch—tries to chip Onana—JUST OVER!

Alvarez holds it up—waits—lays it to De Bruyne, who chips it over the top—Foden’s in again! Controls! SHOOTS—BLOCKED by Varane again! United are throwing bodies like it’s a warzone." },

City dominate possession now—71%—but United’s threat in transition is real. Shaw and Dalot are tucked in narrow, almost forming a back five out of possession. Ten Hag’s plan is clear: compress, survive, break." },
      "20": { "type": "commentary", "text": "Still no goals, but you’d think it’s 3–3 with the energy inside Old Trafford. Every challenge, every flick, every break is met with roars. Both teams have tested the keepers, defenders are blocking like their lives depend on it, and the tempo is ferocious. The stage is set—something’s going to give soon." },

He drives forward like a number eight now—finds Bernardo Silva, who’s drifting central. Silva dinks it to De Bruyne—tight angle on the edge of the box—he cuts in—SHOOTS! Over the bar! But that was clever movement. United are having to defend on a knife’s edge." },
      "22": { "type": "commentary", "text": "United try to escape the pressure—Onana goes long. Rashford challenges Walker in the air—brings it down! Flicks it wide to Garnacho. The Argentine sprints—past Gvardiol again! He’s into the box—low cross! McTominay meets it! Blocks! Chaos! And then it’s scrambled away by Dias. This is breathless football." },

Xavi is pacing nervously near the touchline; Ancelotti calmly chews gum with the nonchalance of a man who’s seen it all. The referee checks his watch... and we are LIVE! El Clásico has begun!"
